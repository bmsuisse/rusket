    "# SASRec: Session-Based Next-Best-Product\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business problem:** Your store has many **anonymous / new visitors** — they have no purchase history at all. Classical collaborative filtering (ALS, BPR, LightGCN) cannot help them because they have no embeddings. But you *do* know what they clicked on in the current session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SASRec?** Unlike Markov-chain models (FPMC), the **self-attention mechanism** captures *long-range dependencies* within a session — so a user who browsed Espresso Maker → Grinder → Scales is likely interested in whole-bean Coffee, not in unrelated items that appear in simple co-occurrence tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases covered:\n",
    "1. **Real-time next-product widget** — \"Based on what you've viewed…\"\n",
    "2. **Personalised push notification** — what to show a user who hasn't returned in 7 days\n",
    "3. **Session-quality score** — how focused / intentional is this browse session?\n",
    "4. **Cart abandonment recovery** — predict what the user intended to buy but didn't\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dataset:** MovieLens 100k (publicly available). We treat each user's chronological viewing history as a browse session, and model \"what they watch next\" — the exact same pattern as \"what they buy next\"."
